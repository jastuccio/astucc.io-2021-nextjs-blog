The image below shows my VSCode above and Wes' setup below.  There are 2 issues.\n\n1. I do not have an option for 'JS' for this file. \n   * my options are 'jsx', 'javascriptreact', or 'Babel Javascript'\n2. I am not getting the ESLint link and not sure why or if ESLint is being run on this file.\n\n \n![Alt Text](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dt9dgqynbmau0ctuujgg.png)\n\nVSCode prefs:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"breadcrumbs.enabled\": true,\n  \"cSpell.language\": \"en,en-US\",\n  \"colorize.include\": [\".tsx\", \".jsx\", \".ts\", \".js\"],\n  \"colorize.languages\": [\n    \"css\",\n    \"sass\",\n    \"scss\",\n    \"less\",\n    \"postcss\",\n    \"sss\",\n    \"stylus\",\n    \"xml\",\n    \"svg\",\n    \"javascript\",\n    \"javascriptreact\"\n  ],\n  \"emmet.includeLanguages\": {\n    \"svelte\": \"html\",\n    \"javascript\": \"javascriptreact\"\n  },\n  \"emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab\": true,\n  \"editor.cursorStyle\": \"underline\",\n  \"editor.cursorBlinking\": \"blink\",\n  \"editor.detectIndentation\": false,\n  \"editor.fontSize\": 14,\n  \"editor.fontFamily\": \"'Fira Code iScript', Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace\",\n  \"editor.fontLigatures\": true,\n  \"editor.formatOnPaste\": true,\n  \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n  \"editor.tabSize\": 2,\n  \"editor.wordWrap\": \"on\",\n  \"eslint.autoFixOnSave\": true,\n  \"files.autoSave\": \"onFocusChange\",\n  \"files.associations\": {\n    \"*.svelte\": \"html\",\n    \"*.mdx\": \"markdown\",\n    \"*.fish\": \"powershell\"\n  },\n  \"files.trimTrailingWhitespace\": true,\n  \"json.format.enable\": false,\n  \"prettier.disableLanguages\": [\n    \"javascript\",\n    \"javascriptreact\"\n  ],\n  \"prettier.requireConfig\": true,\n  \"prettier.singleQuote\": true,\n  \"prettier.jsxSingleQuote\": true,\n  \"prettier.trailingComma\": \"es5\",\n\n  \"peacock.favoriteColors\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Angular Red\",\n      \"value\": \"#b52e31\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Auth0 Orange\",\n      \"value\": \"#eb5424\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Azure Blue\",\n      \"value\": \"#007fff\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"C# Purple\",\n      \"value\": \"#68217A\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Gatsby Purple\",\n      \"value\": \"#639\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Go Cyan\",\n      \"value\": \"#5dc9e2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Java Blue-Gray\",\n      \"value\": \"#557c9b\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"JavaScript Yellow\",\n      \"value\": \"#f9e64f\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Mandalorian Blue\",\n      \"value\": \"#1857a4\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Node Green\",\n      \"value\": \"#215732\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"React Blue\",\n      \"value\": \"#00b3e6\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Something Different\",\n      \"value\": \"#832561\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Vue Green\",\n      \"value\": \"#42b883\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"peacock.affectTitleBar\": false,\n  \"peacock.affectStatusBar\": true,\n  \"window.zoomLevel\": 1,\n  \"workbench.colorTheme\": \"Cobalt2\",\n  \"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\n        \"editorError.foreground\":   \"#00000000\",\n        // \"editorWarning.foreground\": \"#00000000\",\n        // \"editorInfo.foreground\":    \"#00000000\"\n    },\n  \"workbench.editor.highlightModifiedTabs\": true,\n  \"workbench.sideBar.location\": \"right\",\n  \"workbench.sideBar.location\": \"right\",\n  \"[javascript]\": {\n    \"editor.formatOnSave\": false\n  },\n    \"[javascriptreact]\": {\n      \"editor.formatOnSave\": false,\n    },\n    \"[markdown]\": {\n      \"files.trimTrailingWhitespace\": false,\n      \"editor.formatOnSave\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAny ideas why this setup isn't working?"}}]
